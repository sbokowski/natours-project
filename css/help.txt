 project overview : 

 Step 
  What you will learn in this lecture?
     The best way to perform a basic 
     reset using the universal selector
    
     HOw to set project wide fornt 
     defintions.

     How to clip parts of elemnts using
     clip-path
   
   Step 1
  
      Needed setup:
 the uviversal selector , inheritance
 files, css, folders , starter file
Help  on project:
so lets start coding in the next video !

Step  2 
notes:  fonts 
Classification: Humanist , font type
For naturtours - we are using "Lato" font family 

Step 3
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lato:ital,wght@0,100;0,300;0,400;0,700;0,900;1,100;1,300;1,400;1,700;1,900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

Step 4
 Note: set the fornt weight to 400 
 in body  
 
 Step 2
 Set a background image with 2 colors for gradiet
 color , to overlay image gradient.

 Step 3  
      clip-path , specify a polygon 
  next we use a modern css property called 
  clipath,  a closed vector path or shape used to cut out
   or mask an image or element
  
           clip path maker
     verital image 
        clip-path: polygon(0 0, 16% 0, 16% 100%, 0% 100%);

            make different shapes

  note: img element is an inline 
  
  Step 4 
    logo image  install , use ablsolute positioning

 Step 5 
   make h1 tag , h1 tag is important tag for 
 google looking for . with the span element

   note : by default span element is inline 

   Step 6  
     Makke   Outdoors 
          is where life happpers   >>> center 
  <!--  align in center with absolute positionning -->
 
 Step 7 
   next do some animation to  
     Outdoors  , using @keyframes 
     @keyframes moveInLeft 
           {
       0%  {
         
       }
           
        80% {

        }
        100% {

        }
      }

      Step 8
       design button hover , 
      center ,  add padding, 

      Step 9 
        add margin for button 60px

      Step 10 
        adjust hover button

      Step 11
          make hover button hoaver 
      and activer mover up annd down 
      and border raduis 
      add tranition to button 
     
     Step  11 
        Specificity , remember what markup 
        gets the value , when codes gets 
        complex , know the specificity of 
        what will get the higher specific 
        where your code , if something is not
        working in your code .
       
    Step 11 
       How css values are processed
         Font width ,
           if not declared has 
         a default value of 16px;

    Step 11a 
        Inheritance - passes the values for some
      specific properites from parents to
      children

    Step 12  Build a complex button pt 2 ?? 
        did not finish 

    Step 13    
          Implementing BEM in the Natours 
           projext
        Block, , Elemeent , Modifier 
       The Block, Element, Modifier methodology 
       (commonly referred to as BEM) is a popular
        naming convention 
       for classes in HTML and CSS.

     The Think  - Build -Architect Mindset

    Responsive design ,
     Code should be maintainable 
      Performance

    Clear, modular , reusable , ready for growth

      thnk about the layout of your webpag
      build your layout in html and css with consisten
      create a logical arctitecture for file, etc
  
      Component - which will speed up your 
       development  

  Step  15 
     the 7 folders
       7 different folders for partail  Sass
       files and 1 main  
       base , components, layout, pages ,
       themes, abstracts , vendors.

     Step 16 
          Section: 
     
       Introduction to SASS and Npm

        Lesson 

         What is SASS  
         Sass is a css pre procesor and extention 
         of CSS , which adds power and elegance 
         to the basic language 

         What are the features that sass gives us?
         
        First we have 

         Variables 
         - for reusable values such as
         colors, fornt, font-sizes , spacing,etc

         Next we have Nesting

         Nesting - 
          to nest selectors inside of one 
         another allowing us to write less code

         Next up 
         
         Operators -
          for mathemical operations 
          right inside of CSS
         
        Next up 

        Partials and imports - 
        to write CSS in different files and importing
        them all into one single flie

        Next 

         Mixins -
         to write reusable pieces of CSS code

        Next

         Functions -
         similar to mixins with difference that 
         they produce a value that can be used

         Next up 

         Extends -
         to make different selectors inherit 
         declarations that are common to all of
         them   

         and finally 

         Control directives -
         for writing complex code using 
         conditonal and loops , >
          > not covered in this course
       
       Step 
          Use codepen  for SASS , go to seting 
          change the setting  in CSS preprossor

         Note on Advanced CSS: 
            calculating windows font size , parents and
              inheriance
          
            How CSS Style Sheet is parsed , value processing :
             Advanced CSS 
 
              Each property has a value initially , used if 
              nothing is declared  and if   there is no 
              inheritance .

             Browser specify  root size for fonts , for 
              page -usually 16px.

             Percentages and relative values are always converted
              to pixels .

            Percentages are measured to their parent's  font size,
            if used to  specify                 

             Vh and vw  are simply. percentages measurements of 
             view ports   heights and width

            rems font size are always measure relative to to the
             documents   root font size..

         Lessons 

         Next Lecture , where we are going to talk about 
          inheritance that we only touched breifly in previous 
          lecture.

          Inheritance 

          So, Inheritance is a way of propagating property.
          values , from parent element to their  children

          Inheritance , 
          there are some propertys that can be inherited
          and others are not

          Line-height -
            get inherited ,gets computed 
          value from its parent elemnt  , it will get 
          a computed value

          Inheritance passes the values for some specific
          properties from parent to children - 
           -->  more maintainable code. 

          The inherit keyword forces inheritance on a 
          certain property . 

       Lesson 

       IN this lecture how and why we use rem units 
       in out project, and why you should do the 
       same.  And of course , work flow to convert
       pixels to rem in the easiest way.

        Lesson change rem values to px
       Set meaurements to rem  
    
    Lesson
   
   Note :
    Internet explorer does not support rem values;
